* kitty's Emacs config
  Sometimes, I like to use Emacs. I think it's a good environment for
  programming and writing text (which is what I'm doing right now),
  it's extremely extensible, it has a nice interface and it has some
  of the best packages for anything ever.

  I have my Emacs config spread out into different files, because I
  think it's cool. So far it's working pretty well. All of my config
  scripts are in el/.
