I might die of frostbite I might catch my death
I'll make use of my air while I am out of breath
My body it is frozen as I am caked in ice
I must conserve my heat now a blanket might suffice
I might as well be dead I'm grey and very stiff
My box I will approach now and lie within as if
I'm cold oh very so cold ha ha ha ha ha
I'm cold oh very so cold ha ha ha ha ha
I'm cold oh very so cold ha ha ha ha ha
I'm cold oh very so cold
I'm cold oh very so cold ha ha ha ha ha
I'm cold oh very so cold ha ha ha ha ha
Being here alone I hardly find the time to see my way
Never hear it clearer sitting on this bright and sunny day
Now I feel inclined to look upon you now I’ll never know
Playing on the slide and swings and around and 'round we go
Leave me, leave me, can’t you see that I’m weary
I never had what I desired
And you wouldn’t let me
Play with the other kids
There outside, they weren’t good enough for
Me, while I sit here and scheme
With Rabbit and Teddy
Sweet revenge is asking me
To be set free
I’d like to see you sometimes
If only for a moment, take your time
I can really see now
And I know what’s yours
And know what’s mine
I see it’s hopeless
Now the final stages have begun
Like it when it’s raining
Makes it so much wetter than the sun
Turning back the pages of my new diary
Talk to the postman makes no sense
There wasn't the time to illustrate
I never seem to find the time to say
It’s hard
Oil my machine and keep it functioning
Watch the clock make sure that I'm not
Running out of running out of time time
And I can't see I
Argument and controversy
Never seem quite right to me
As usual only usually mine
Oh yeah
Once before and twice again
A hopeless case but now and then
We’re laughing
Oh we're laughing all the time time
So I can't see I
Spiderman, Spiderman
Does whatever a spider can
A spider can
Please be in when I get home
Don't want to sit here on my own
Here on my own
Watch the time
Suit yourself
See the clock upon the shelf
Can't see it myself
She uses Windolene
To keep her children clean
Keeps her washing machine
New as the day
It was new as the day
Colder than very cold
Though I am getting old
They say I won't be told
Now I know better ‘cos
They're getting wetter than me
Argument and controversy
Never seem quite right to me
As usual
Only usually mine
Once before and twice again
A hopeless case but now and then
We're laughing
Oh we’re laughing all the time
So I can see I
Squalor is at large in tidy suburbia
Filth and dirt abound in every corner yes
Things left on the floor
Abandoned foodstuffs and things left on the floor
Piles of dirty stuff left to go off and things
To go off and things
Got to tidy up my room tidy my room
Put my things away and make it spick and span
Make things spick and span
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Take it Sarah
Squalor
Is
At large
In
Tidy
Subur-bia
Squalor is at large in tidy suburbia
Filth and dirt abound in every corner yes
To go off and things
Count me out for this one for my head is not well
I might try just this once but only because
I don't want to be alone and sit by myself
And watch you all have fun, no that's not for me.
They've tucked me in and left me and I lie here in the gloom
The lights left on the landing but switched off in my room
There are shadows in the corner and the thingies in my head
Grin callously sly and slimy
To my bed as they crawl under
Rather be seen than not heard now
Although I've been left to be here all on my own
Why can't you stay with me till I'm sleeping
Late night black delirium I'm too hot for an answer
Dinner can't be spoiled
The mouses in my garden used to grow so big and strong
But now my mouses wither cause they know where they belong
I had a little gnomie little plastic figurine
And when I wasn't looking he was nowhere nowhere to be seen
Rather be seen than not heard now
Although I've been left to be here all on my own
Although I do as I'm told, Although I am as good as good as gold
Why can't you stay with me till I'm sleeping
Late night black delirium I'm too hot for an answer
Dinner can't be spoiled
I just can't understand although I try and try
It's just totally beyond my comprehension
I just can't understand although I try and try
It's just totally beyond my comprehension
It's not as if I try to please I only try to please it's not as if I try
Say hello to me everyday make it clear you know I'm here until I go away
Exhibitionist Dandy Extrovert try my best to be the same as you or them
If I had lots of rabbits I would let them wander free
Cause then the prickly hedgehogs would never bother me
Tiny mice at playtime in their little cages how I like them
(Cameras. One, two, three, four.)
They also clack (psh, psh), and pop
And they wind, wind
What can I do?
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Mom!
I don't wanna bite any puddings, Dad!
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
And you don't need it
Soon you'll find out that I'm in a vision
And I can't be seen. Might as well be over
I can't see well people can't see me
Soon you'll find out you're not so clever
So clever you are not so
Getting up my nose
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
Leave me alone
I don't wanna go with you
And what they'll see is what I see
You can't watch me
Just cause I'm watching you
Just get on with breathing
Getting on, not much time
Best say I can sleep now
Can't you tell me a good story?
Make it stand well in history
You can't watch me
Just cause I'm watching you
Just get on with breathing
Getting on, not much time
Best say I can sleep now
Can't you tell me a good story?
Make it stand well in history
You run when you're called
You pretend not to hear
Convinient that this saves you coming here
You come in here
You're afraid of us though we've done nothing to you
When we call, you go running to
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
I can see you where you're hiding
I can see you where you're hiding
I can see you where you're hiding
You seem buried in your ways
Now I can see what it is that makes seem as though as if it's here to stay
Maybe if I close the door more permanently than before he'll change his ways
When all is quiet and asleep, I might just slip away
And when they find that I am gone, I wonder what they'll say
When all is quiet and asleep, I might just slip away
And when they find that I am gone, I wonder what they'll say
You run when you're called
You pretend not to hear
Convinient that this saves you coming here
You come in here
You're afraid of us though we've done nothing to you
When we call, you go running to
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
Hide in your dark room, in your dark room
It's much better in here when you close the door
That's in the dark and out the light
It's better than before
Things become much clearer when the curtains close and lights withdraw
Makes things much clearer than before
I can see you where you're hiding
I can see you
See you, though you're not really there
Things become much clearer when the curtains close and lights withdraw
Makes things much clearer than before
Will you hear me when I ask you why when you lock the door and hide the key you seem much happier than me?
Hello little doggie my you are a nice dog
What did you just say then? You can do some tricks
Oh good then will you show me?
My word that's a good one
Would you like a cigarette?
No you can’t they're bad for you
Uh oh icky qualms
I'm getting sick of just sitting around
Cause you think that by keeping me I'm safe and sound
You wrap me up and you keep me warm
But you think I've just been fucking born
You don't realise that was quite some time ago
I'm old enough now to be set free
Cause I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
Cause I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
My mum's obscene, My Dad's obscene
The vicar's obscene OH GOD
I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
I tell them I'm a man but they don't believe me
But if I'm still here in the morning
They banned the bomb and the war on want
And they banned Richard Davis they won't allow the rabies
As far as I'm concerned that's a load of bull
I know I'm a rebel what I need is a cause
But if I'm still here in the morning
It might seem like a cheap way to escape
You're having delusions of grandeur
It didn't need no other to point it out
Just to hide my thoughts away
No, I can't see it
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over
Makes me quite confused
It never feels quite the same
Sometimes in this state of mind
I find it hard to say in a different way
Sometimes in this state of mind
I find it hard to say in a different way
Makes me sad
Makes me sad
Isn't it an awful shame?
I can't see me when it's raining
It seems to be
Never stopped to notice
And I try to find another way
It's getting harder every day
Try to find another way
It's getting harder every day
When you find out you're not so bad
At all
After all
But I can't see any way
Getting harder every day
Getting harder every day
Always something in my mind
Could be why I'm feeling fine
Seeing is believing though
Stand here at the window
And I try to find another way
It's getting harder every day
Try to find another way
It's getting harder every day
When you find out you're not so bad
At all
After all
But I can't see any way
Getting harder every day
Getting harder every day
Nobody mentioned
Possibly leave your self-discretion
And turn me all around
Not to have to tell me
What’s around underground
And turn me all around
Gets me down so mind my manners
My own mind soon puts me under
Think I care to think that I’m
Concerned about some backstreet wonder
But then again
Far it’s going to live past time
Easily ignored when I’m aware
Sheepily
Enjoing myself in time
A-weighing that everybody’s there
Take me home I shouldn’t mind
I wouldn’t in your sorry situation
And to put me in the backseat
From the taxi drivеr
Nobody mentioned
Possibly leavе your self-discretion
And turn me all around
Not to have to tell me
What’s around underground

Another day in a small way
A heyday for the average ego
It’s ok it must be good ‘cos
They say - it’s nighttime
Bide my time tomorrow is
Another day but not to mention
Be expected childhood ending up
A song in childhood even
Well not quite as so good as
My body where’s the backseat driver
(-seat driver, -seat driver)
It’s my thick skin
It’s finer
It’s finer
Inside her
It’s finer
It’s finer
Inside her
It’s finer
It’s finer
Inside her
Bide my time tomorrow is
Another day but not to mention
Just another big noise in a

The scratching crawling scrawling
The grimy wardrobe closes
My getaway is closing for yet another day
But dimmer getting brighter is
Pushing me down to the ground
With your foot passing over over the top of me
But will you let me know that my leg is on fire
My getaway is closing for yet another day
But scratching crawling scrawling
And the dribble on my bed
Images of them coming up to me and I hear them say
But what they say don’t matter anyway
Easy come easy go I know it well that is
So pressures building bound to give although I might be wrong
Run out of words to say on the train
You came up here in the rain and back again for a while smile at me and one day we’ll see
What is seeing is believing though what I'm seeing
I don’t believe but you know I might be wrong
Cold as can be in an English sea
Oh to be beside the sea oh can’t we be beside the seaside
Happens over and over again
Happens over and over again
Knock at the door hello come inside for a word or maybe a cup of tea would be nice oh
I'll make a pot do stay
Ant and Bee and the ABC cold as can be in an English sea
And everything it's ever meant to me
Well that’s great coming from you seeing as how it’s you who makes the world go round as we all know
See the light shine above you see the light shine around you sunshine everywhere you go
And I ask for information concerning the duty to that concerns you
And you laugh at me I ask you is it true that there are four of you to every one of me?
Turning round again all the time
You pass me in the rain how are you today
It's a toy world
It's a toy world
It's a toy world
It's a toy world
Following around to see a life
That's never in
Always calling itself on its own phone
Though its never quite at home in the world today
See it to arranging the day
Prepared in its own s-special way
With added loving care
Though it's not been there since yesterday
Looking so hard for a cause
And it don't care what it is
And never really ever seeing eye to eye
Though it doesn't really mind, perhaps it's why
It never really saw
Never really saw
Saw, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw...
You’re never in, I called again
I’ve been around twice today
No friend of mine, no enemy
So who exactly are you?
When you’re nearer me now, and then
But never before did it seem so far away and hostile to me
The nerve is bared, the sense is real
There's places and houses
Spires inspire to find the time to
Times are finе, find the time
The nursеs find me in again
Oh now, simpering nurses whispering verses
Spoiling our vacant ever-changing pointless situation
To stay here, or even to play here
Rather than kept in on my own
We only know what goes to show
What to and ask me why
Oh we’re in again, oh we’re all the same
Turning around, it seems so strange now
Don’t mind the unbalanced mind
It’s mine, and mine is yours to
Share with me and me is clean and…
Oh now, simpering nurses whispering verses
Hold me away from you I’ll stay, but I don’t really think so
Maybe
I don’t think I care
Close me slowly round and round and we’ll see
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah well, another day now
I know I can't
See eye-to-eye no more
I’m free
The way it should be
And the life
That was chosen for me
And my things are never really changing
And the people always ask me:
Why hide?
There is no time
For the things
And me
For it's odd
I'm inclined to agree
But I’ll tell them everything so quickly
Disappointed still
Never mind -
In heaven
Everything is fine
In heaven
Everything is fine
In heaven
Everything is fine
In heaven
Everything is fine
In heaven
Everything is fine
In heaven
Everything is fine
Try to relax me now but then again
Oh no! Isn't it good?
Why do I feel so misunderstood?
Could it be that I'm peeling?
Look at my finger
Wait here just for a moment
Look at me wiggle
No wonder I'm feeling bored all the time
Could it be that I'm wrong
I'm right I'm wrong but then again
Oh, it would be nice for everyone
It would be nice for everyone
Oh what a lovely way to be
Oh what a lovely way to be
It would be nice for everyone
It would be nice for everyone
Oh what a lovely way to be
Oh what a lovely way to be
Sit me down and make me stay
To say the first things on my mind
"My Soldier, Will Hay
Silver bells and cockle shells and
Er, pretty maids all in a row"
'Cause my leg is a part of me
I always knew what was wrong with me
I could tell by my general attitude (attitude)
I always knew it would get physical (physical?)
I could tell by my longitude latitude oh...
What's on the table?
Good Lord! Look at the cakes!
I'm gonna go and eat them all up
Or is it that I'm dreaming?
Look at my finger
Wait here just for a moment
Look at me wiggle
No wonder I'm feeling bored all the time
Could it be that I'm wrong
I'm right I'm wrong but then again
Oh, it would be nice for everyone
It would be nice for everyone
Oh what a lovely way to be
Oh what a lovely way to be
It would be nice for everyone
It would be nice for everyone
Oh what a lovely way to be
Oh what a lovely way to be
Sit me down and make me stay
To say the first things on my mind
"My Soldier, Will Hay
Silver bells and cockle shells and
Er, pretty maids all in a row, yeah"
I always knew what was wrong with me
I could tell by my general attitude, attitude
I always knew it would get physical
As a part of my longitude latitude
It's the same I sometimes wonder
If something or other's in my headbone
It's the same I sometimes wonder
If something or other's in my headbone
Look at my finger
Wait here just for a moment
Look at me wiggle
No wonder I'm feeling bored all the time
Could it be that I'm wrong
I'm right I'm wrong but then again
Here's me, hidden in the underground
And so far I don't mind
That's why, a-ha
You'll find I'm never coming here
Buy me all the things I ask for
Nothing's too much for me
Here more often than not
A burst investigating main
Never before did it seem what it used to seem
I'm right by night time, find the right time
One day I'll be getting older
And so what happens now?
On the big screen
Or should I leave it all behind?
You laugh and I can never hear you
Never before did I know
A bigger chance to be congenial
Once had a go on my own
Oh no, see who's getting nearer
All efforts wasted now
That's why I'm right believing
Everything I see
What's new, "Bulldog Drummond's Peril"?
"The Tragedy of a Switchboard Operator"?
Another "Weekend World"?
Never before did it seem what it used to seem
I'm packaged right like Gina Lollobrigida
You laugh and I can never hear you
Never before did I know
A bigger chance to be congenial
Once had a go on my own
You laugh and I can never hear you
Never before did I know
A bigger chance to be congenial
Once had a go on my own
My leg is
On fire oh
Isn't it a fact
I've seen it
And it appears quite a task lasting forever
I've got the mind of an eel
But I'm fizzing all the time
Mind of an eel
But I'm fizzing all the time
I'd say, I'd say
I'd say, I'd say
Fine accomplished day to day
Bide my time in my own way
It's passing me over
Meet me once upon a time
But obviously don't ignore it's me
I'm here you see
I've got no say in it anyway
Isn't it a gas?
What a funny thing to say
Why do you stay in
On such a lovely sunny day?
I'd say, I'd say
I'd say, I'd say
Fine accomplished day to day
Bide my time in my own way
It's passing me over
Meet me once upon a time
But obviously don't ignore it's me
I'm here you see
I've got no say in it anyway
"Ha ha ha ha!"
I suppose I could start
Closed behind the door
People looking at me
Ha ha ha ha
See the big ship sailing by
Pick me up and turn me round
Into the disarray around me
Somedays this and somedays that
It's acting so banal awhile
So ask me nicely
La la la la
Ask me nicely
La la la la
Wild thing you make everything groovy
You make everything groovy
These giraffes eat leaves
And they run oh so very fast
If you wanted to catch one, yeah
You would have to take a car
Long necks so they reach the leaves
Up high in the sky in the trees
They run fast and they have a baby
They would given half the chance to
Ask me nicely
La la la la
Ask me nicely
La la la la
Wild thing you make everything groovy
You make everything
Turn around me all of the time
It seems to be all of the time
So welcome all to
The ugly bug ball
Isn't it a lovely day?
Ha ha ha ha
Watch me running around awhile
Pick me up and turn me round
Into the disarray around me
Somedays this and somedays that
It's acting so banal awhile
So ask me nicely
La la la la
Ask me nicely
La la la la
Wild thing you make everything groovy
You make everything
Turn around me all of the time
It seems to be all of the time
Going around all the shops always closing
Never time to pursue my interests
Will I ever find the time
For a quick taste of the high life?
I'm so perplexed though it doesn't really seem
To affect the high and mighty
And I can't see you ever
Turning up trumps into my life
See me coming up and coming whoops-a-daisy
One, two, nothing counts in this complex world
Lights are in the making
Never see them changing
Always stay the same for me, oh
Out in the air, on the top in the open
Conversation is to be expected
And I can't form the words
So I just maintain my silence
My breathing space is limited
The people always walking
Round my hallway on the stairs below
Always seem to end up on the road before me
Things they really seem to bore me
Driven around all the shops always closing
And it appears that I've been mended
And I can't see me ever
Turning up trumps into your life
See me coming up and coming whoops-a-daisy
One, two, nothing counts in this complex world
Lights are in the making
Never see them changing
Always stay the same for me, oh
You’re never in, I called again
I’ve been around twice today
No friend of mine, no enemy
So who exactly are you?
When you’re nearer me now, and then
But never before did it seem so far away and hostile to me
The nerve is bared, the sense is real
There's places and houses
Spires inspire to find the time to
Times are finе, find the time
The nursеs find me in again
Oh now, simpering nurses whispering verses
Spoiling our vacant ever-changing pointless situation
To stay here, or even to play here
Rather than kept in on my own
We only know what goes to show
What to and ask me why
Oh we’re in again, oh we’re all the same
Turning around, it seems so strange now
Don’t mind the unbalanced mind
It’s mine, and mine is yours to
Share with me and me is clean and…
Oh now, simpering nurses whispering verses
Hold me away from you I’ll stay, but I don’t really think so
Maybe
I don’t think I care
Close me slowly round and round and we’ll see
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah well, another day now
Following around to see a life
That's never in
Always calling itself on its own phone
Though its never quite at home in the world today
See it to arranging the day
Prepared in its own s-special way
With added loving care
Though it's not been there since yesterday
Looking so hard for a cause
And it don't care what it is
And never really ever seeing eye to eye
Though it doesn't really mind, perhaps it's why
It never really saw
Never really saw
Saw, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw...
Leaving early, just before the hour
A few moments won't make any difference, not to me anyway
The early bird catches the worm
I don't really want to go in tomorrow
The man will tell me off for leaving early yesterday
Close your eyes dear, never mind
And there's voices inside me
They're screaming, they're telling me
"That's the way we all go"
There's thousands of people just like me all over
But that's the way we all go
What can I do when everyone's been so helpful?
How can I have the right to say I'm different to you?
Oh
But I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy
That's the way we all go
And if you're bigger you fall a bit harder
But that's the way we all go
There's a pain in my side it's a lesson I learned
From a while ago (That's the way we all go)
I'll be screaming inside, I'll be biting my nails
But it won't show (That's the way we all go)
There's a knock at my door as I fall to the floor
But I still don't know (That's the way we all go)
That the people outside shed a tear for my pride
But they still won't go (That's the way we all go)
Why should I think I'm alone the whole factory thinks
That's the way we all go
Then there's Washington, Tokyo, New York and Moscow
But that's the way we all go
They're all crying and arguing down the telephone
But that's the way we all go
Then there's me standing here with my whole life to spare
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
It's easier when you know how obviously but that's how it goes
(That's the way we all go)
Look at me now I know something that you don't
But that's the way we all go
The turning wheel reeks of the whale and the whaler
But that's the way we all go
The early bird catches the worm
Does the worm think that that's the way we all go?
Don't pity me
My sun shines only for me
Occasionally gives me hope
For the day I always wanted
I know the part that's never learned by anyone-two
So stick it up your arse by the left Mr Soldier
I'm safer on my own
When you go home
You'll all be in boxes so piss on you
Fighters right or wrong
Look at me now
Wow I'm impressed
You'll see when you
See me on the beach
See me on the beach
See me on the beach it gives me
Hope for the day I always wanted
Uniform a man of action
Uniform a man of action
Blame him to save blaming me
I can't quite reach him
Seeing is believing
But it never occured to me to do so anyway
I feel as high as the moon
But never mind it's hope day soon
It's plain to see I'm only bluffing
Man of action see him suffering
Dead men tell no tales
It seems that I'm halfway home
Blame him to save blaming me
And hurting someone pointlessly is
As easy as ABC
So carve me out an effigy
Passive action leaves no traces
Dead soldiers with silly faces
Mr "S" holds all the aces
Playing games and winning races
My soldier I kill you
Though I loved you more than all the world
The thought of dying makes me ill
I'm scared because I want to kill
So Blame him to save blaming me
And hurting someone pointlessly is
As easy as ABC
So carve me out an effigy
Thinking back now
Lazing on hazy days although in many ways
It’s always a task
What we used to see on the TV
On saturdays seems so far away
I think to myself now’s the time to self indulge
And on the other side is a program
About someone who died
I get so tired
Dinner time is at home not here
Mine is the truth
Never ending year after year
A change of scene, I know
Oh happy days meeting people on the way
And on the TV screen
(oh dear, what’s the time
You used to be a friend of mine)
So we go now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
I’m turning round now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
What’s happening now, I never see eye to eye
All ideas blown up high in the sky
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
I’ve got to go home into my own world
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
I’ve got to go home into my own world
Thinking back now
Lazing on hazy days although in many ways
It’s always a task
What we used to see on the TV
On saturdays seems so far away
I think to myself now’s the time to self indulge
And on the other side is a program
About someone who died
I get so tired
Dinner time is at home not here
Mine is the truth
Never ending year after year
Time…
You used to be a friend of mine
I can sense a change in mind
You used to be a friend of mine
I can sense a change in mind
You used to be a friend of mine
I can sense a change in mind
You used to be a friend of mine
I can sense a change in mind
So we go now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
I’m turning round now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
So we go now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
I’m turning round now
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
I’ve got to go home into my own world
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
I’ve got to go home into my own world
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
I’ve got to go home into my own world
I’m so sorry which I cannot show
But I can’t say anymore
Its not the same no matter what
Constantly I find myself in hot water again
Bumping into things another twist
Knocking on the door on the see saw
And I wonder would I be missed
Do you know what I mean to say
I meant to say to you today
A day goes by I try thats why
I try to speak to you today
Pointless to assume it means the same
Everybody plays their little games
What they'd always said to me
Do you know what the things you said
You'd know I'd hoped you'd know you know
Just what they'd always said to me
But I laugh
And I cry
But I don't
Really mind
Though it seems
To be as always
Sing me lullabies
Make me close my eyes
Always seemed so frail
Can't talk to me can't talk to you
You just ignore the things I do
Bumping into things they're always twist-ing
Knocking on the door on the see saw
And I wonder would I be missed
Do you know what I mean to say
I meant to say to you today
A day goes by I try thats why
I try to speak to you today
Doggy noises coming up to me it's a crime
Everybody plays their little games you do
What they'd always said to me
Do you know what the things you said
You'd know I'd hoped you'd know you know
Just what they'd always said to me
Ice
Ice a spot
And a dot
On the dog
From the dog
Is this what we find
Meant to say to you
Nasty things you do
Make me see it through
Back round to the start
Always in the dark
It seems strange but now's the time
For me or you to certify our never coming here
A stitch in time saves nine in time
To stay alive 'cause we are so divine
In my mind I can't stop dying
I wish there was no stopping me now
In the hope I'm to grow old
I've been told to keep my head down to the ground
It's like standing in the playground looking at the ground
Trying not to notice all the kids around
The will to be kind is mine
But that's the way we all go
The people subsiding are always advising
That that's the way we all go
Calling is craving is letting the rain in
It peers at me and is it understanding? Ha!
Holding me with all its derelict charm
Rushing round me and slipping but never falling — down!
"Give me something I don't need"
My friend cried till his face bled really really red
It stays here all my life, it fears towards me
A stitch in time saves nine in time
But that's the way we all go
The higher the chances the higher the climb
But that's the way we all go
Is everybody happy?
Ah but I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy
That's the way we all go
There's thousands of people just like me all over
But that's the way we all go
My hope day is forever coming closer
My hopes and fears are uncommon and it's he
Who asks for me now
So I'll stay here until it's saving my life
Sing la la la la la la la
I'd say
Squalor is at large in tidy suburbia
Filth and dirt abound in every corner yes
Things left on the floor
Abandoned foodstuffs and things left on the floor
Piles of dirty stuff left to go off and things
To go off and things
Got to tidy up my room tidy my room
Put my things away and make it spick and span
Make things spick and span
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Cast aspersions on my lifestyle
Take it Sarah
Squalor
Is
At large
In
Tidy
Subur-bia
Squalor is at large in tidy suburbia
Filth and dirt abound in every corner yes
To go off and things
Leaving early, just before the hour
A few moments won't make any difference, not to me anyway
The early bird catches the worm
I don't really want to go in tomorrow
The man will tell me off for leaving early yesterday
Close your eyes dear, never mind
And there's voices inside me
They're screaming, they're telling me
"That's the way we all go"
There's thousands of people just like me all over
But that's the way we all go
What can I do when everyone's been so helpful?
How can I have the right to say I'm different to you?
Oh
But I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy
That's the way we all go
And if you're bigger you fall a bit harder
But that's the way we all go
There's a pain in my side it's a lesson I learned
From a while ago (That's the way we all go)
I'll be screaming inside, I'll be biting my nails
But it won't show (That's the way we all go)
There's a knock at my door as I fall to the floor
But I still don't know (That's the way we all go)
That the people outside shed a tear for my pride
But they still won't go (That's the way we all go)
Why should I think I'm alone the whole factory thinks
That's the way we all go
Then there's Washington, Tokyo, New York and Moscow
But that's the way we all go
They're all crying and arguing down the telephone
But that's the way we all go
Then there's me standing here with my whole life to spare
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
It's easier when you know how obviously but that's how it goes
(That's the way we all go)
Look at me now I know something that you don't
But that's the way we all go
The turning wheel reeks of the whale and the whaler
But that's the way we all go
The early bird catches the worm
Does the worm think that that's the way we all go?
Oh what a plain necessity to be alive
Always too soon to criticise
I have had under my eyes and nose
My mouth singing me lullabies
I have no right to complain that I am alone
And have no-one permanently
But if one "takes it by the hand" the "funny man" laughs
Forever landing them on me
Oh what a plain necessity to be alive
Always too soon to criticise
I have had under my eyes and nose
My mouth singing me lullabies
I have no right to complain that I am alone
And have no-one permanently
But if one "takes it by the hand" the "funny man" laughs
Forever landing them on me
Biting while I'm cutting deep
Makes me end up with a clean sweep, making all my fears
Completely dissolve away
The saving up for the hope day disappears (Get off!)
It's funny how when you breathe in
Your mouth opens, air goes in
She won't boil using Teflon on her
Should I go and put the kettle on her?
Michael's got himself a girlfriend, he's a lucky fellow
Katy's top was as white as ever, but now it's gone all yellow
Malcolm's a bastard and keeps acting like Emperor Nero
Peter is constantly pretending to be a superhero
What's in a name, la la la, what's in a name, la la la
What's in a name, la la la, what's in a name, la la la
Biting while I'm cutting deep
Makes me end up with a clean sweep, making all my fears
(La la la-la-la-la)
Completely dissolve away
The saving up for the hope day disappears
The funny man hiding something
Hands me one thing, trying not to laugh
Then he gives me news of an epitaph
For the creatures dying in my bath
Tracy is turning and revolving in a city lining
Martin keeps his new Lambretta gleaming and shining
All news has its way then leaves me staring at my pillow
All clouds have a silver lining gleaming and shining
All of the time
On the Siegfried Line
All news has its way then leaves me staring at my pillow
All clouds have a silver lining gleaming and shining
Firstly there’s a spanner in here
Secondly it has the right of way, YES!
And something else is missing
Sometimes sorted out and wrapped up straight away,
Nothing by comparison puts thoughts straight in my mind
As I comfort myself with the will to be unkind,
Goes the way of every day
To hell with uncle, I...
Mr. Technique’s doing well
And he stands around in poses just like this...
But when I gets to thinking it seems
Better to betray me with a kiss,
We will inform you from day to day,
Mr. Technique’s is much a better way,
(A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES)
(Mr. Walmesley spits...) "Forget responsibilities"
(and I say) "and showbiz personalities??"
HA!
Goes the way of every day to hell with uncle, I know I'm wrong
It must be all this eating in bed, tell me when it’s over.
A spider is crawling up and eating in bed
(Catch this, in a minute)
No-one can see or say or do what no-one wants or not to do
It’s scary to be that way
So I'll make use of my body,
I’ll be round with the tarring can
And stand with the standard man
Who paints us inseparable
But should I break my fall?
In every cry of every Man
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear,
Goes the way of every day
To hell with uncle, I know I'm wrong
It must be all this eating in bed, tell me when it’s over.
A spider is crawling up and eating in bed
Goes the way of every day
To hell with uncle, I know I'm wrong
It must be all this eating in bed, tell me when it’s over.
A spider is crawling up and eating in my bed
No-one can see or say or do
What no-one wants or not to do
It’s scary to be that way
I'll make use of my body,
The woman with the clap takes me round to the back to the man with the crocodile smile who scares me to my hands and knees but should I break my fall?
Following around to see a life
That's never in
Always calling itself on its own phone
Though its never quite at home in the world today
See it to arranging the day
Prepared in its own s-special way
With added loving care
Though it's not been there since yesterday
Looking so hard for a cause
And it don't care what it is
And never really ever seeing eye to eye
Though it doesn't really mind, perhaps it's why
It never really saw
Never really saw
Saw, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw...
(HELLO)
Cancel out my lowness with a high, so here we go
Caught in arrears with your different ideas
And I'm saving all my troubles in my
Deceptive calendar mind
It's a dreadful situation really
"What's in a name?" says Elaine and her mind is a
Part of everything in time
She is fattened up for eating with all her parts left behind
She's a sucker for your deepness
Shall we d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-dive?
The will and the ability to grow a foetus of my own some time
Dies (But it does it nicely)
The world she says there's wrong in all she says and do-be-do's
We understand, but I can't when her hand is in
Saving all her troubles in her
Deceptive calendar mind
It's a dreadful situation really
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dive!
Life is bad so we are led to believe
Bad news makes money's world go round
Anna Ford hammers a post into a cup of mud
Claiming it is the ground
Really then anything is better than that
Is better than watching your
Fake news win in the end
But now it's my turn, nuh-nuh-nuhnuh-nuh-nuh
(Here we go)
Oh, the grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again
Oh no!
Dive!
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
When is it good or not good
To perceive a petrifying life
Or to solving a problem
That's here tomorrow, gone today
"I am a worthy subject"
Says one person catching somebody out
"And I'm tired of all that I am doing now"
Says somebody else
Not to reason why
Ours is but to do and die
Says you, says I
Yes, it's starting to show
But it's already pie in the sky
No reason if adapted for ordinary use
In everyday lives
There's a clause that's not written down
We assume it's just a disguise
Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
Something is wrong, so how is it now?
Is there something on your mind?
Or are your problems deleting the course
That was set in your mind?
Now we are calm
Don't tell me you are living now
What you lived before
There's a will in everyone's mind
To exude an air of some kind
Think back some years, the age of ten
That's not you, that was someone else
Different thoughts and surroundings
Just memories exist today
When is it good?
Tomorrow, the day after?
Is living but a farce?
There must be truth in what I say
Seeing as how the sun shines from my arse
Dull seems the evergreen style of all our unity
And over the fence
An old mother's sympathy makes a spectacle of life
All for the sake of love
Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
World
"People need to be on the table"
"On the table, we can plead the right to say that I've created my own monster! (created my own monster)"
"Ant and bee and the ABC, hope for the day in my visions"
"I hate this! I wanna go back to my house! Haha, ha! Oh."
"Pa ha haha! Look at him running! Look at our boy! Stupid girl!"
"Ha ha, is everybody happy?"
"Happy as we are, ant and bee and the AB-"
"When I've created my own monster!"
I regard them (by force of habit)
It is so, that's why I
In a few days I will informally la-la-la-la-laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha!
As if withered with despair, which is ever so
Hard
A woman in white surrounded me with a jar
Gave me something I don't need, la la la
But for all I know it's ever so
For all I know it's ever so (ever so)
Ever so hard
Tow, tow the breakfast line
It's not too late, so step in time
Tow, tow the breakfast line
It's easy as can be
Take it fast, take it slow
Take it any way you go
Will despair descend on me?
I don't know
But for all I know it's ever so
For all I know it's ever so (ever so)
Ever so hard
"What's there to lose?" said the general
Selling our dead meat by the pound
Accidents of existence
Will make us all feel duty bound
To send along their one or to pursue a new curriculum
With stinky fingers, takes a chair
Rum ti-tum ti-tum tum-tum
A door is opened up for me
I think again and then decline
The need be not so great
If all descent in perfect peace of mind
Some consider childish dreams a matter of necessity
I almost screw myself to the point of my life's expectancy
"I'll break off all of your charm!" says World
Her egg will burst and will arrive
A man who calls his own tune
Thinking it's so good to be alive
Says, "If these are the best what are the rest to be life?"
As for me, I struggle with words and wisdom accusing
"It's you, it's me, it's him", you see
For all I know, it's coming fast
To colonise my infancy
The space is clean but in-between
It's coloured with anxiety
The failing clause is "Victory Complete with Words"
It's hard to see
That after all it's over and done with supreme variety
A friend indeed is all I need
To show me to an open door
I can only trust myself
I should've thought of that before
They need a catch before I'm under
I will give myself to the war
For all I know, it's coming fast
To colonise my infancy
The space is clean but in-between
It's coloured with anxiety
The failing clause is "Victory Complete with Words"
It's hard to see
That after all it's over and done with supreme variety
A stitch in time saves nine in time
To stay alive 'cause we are so divine
In my mind I can't stop dying
I wish there was no stopping me now
In the hope I'm to grow old
I've been told to keep my head down to the ground
It's like standing in the playground looking at the ground
Trying not to notice all the kids around
The will to be kind is mine
But that's the way we all go
The people subsiding are always advising
That that's the way we all go
Calling is craving is letting the rain in
It peers at me and is it understanding? Ha!
Holding me with all its derelict charm
Rushing round me and slipping but never falling — down!
"Give me something I don't need"
My friend cried till his face bled really really red
It stays here all my life, it fears towards me
A stitch in time saves nine in time
But that's the way we all go
The higher the chances the higher the climb
But that's the way we all go
Is everybody happy?
Ah but I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy
That's the way we all go
There's thousands of people just like me all over
But that's the way we all go
My hope day is forever coming closer
My hopes and fears are uncommon and it's he
Who asks for me now
So I'll stay here until it's saving my life
Sing la la la la la la la
I'd say
It's just a funny world
That hides me out of sight
And I will stay with her
All through the day
And through the night
And if she only had
Stopped making that hissing noise
That haunts me now
And makes a joke of me
With all the other boys
And then the world begins to seethe
Then she releases what's closed in on me
And then asks
"Is it just mud that breaks the whole world window?"
And turns as if to try
So do I
So do I
And when I'm really here
That's when I'm really here
My right life begins to disappear
And I remember my mum
Told me out of all my funny toys
That you won't make a man of me
And growing up's an interesting
Thing to do
And then all life begins to scream
The whole world changes like I've never seen
And then she goes up to the window
And leaps into the sky
So do I
So do I
So do I
So do I
Will you sit down
Is everybody happy?
There is a sign outside your house saying
"Everyone is happy"
Well I for one am most certainly not
Is everybody happy?
Is it just mud that breaks the whole world window?
I'll turn as if to try
Poor soldier now you've created your own monster
Then turn as if to try
Any real egg has a shell as the shell an egg
So break it killer fisty
Killer fisty beat his head
The watching every time beats playing of every kind
And as the way's subsiding every crack is yours for mine
Un-dreaded courage all the time
(Knees up pleading, picks up hope for the drunken line after mine, line after mine)
As if she like sugar as I said she did
She, like a snail, says she, like a gale, says...
'Ideal it's like coming down with a newly born energy
Only trouble is I am too afraid of what was said!'
Ah! Different arms and different eyes
Different colours, different size
Different smell and different cries
Different meaning different life
Only to have white hair caused by the trouble that never comes
And a gale more powerful than all of the guns
Crying need leading astray and steals her gentle smile away came
Made two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for DANGER
World's too big for DANGER
In demolitions all the time
Knees up pleading, picks up hope for the drunken line after mine After mine, after mine
Different arms and different eyes
Different colours, different size
Different smell and different cries
Different meaning
Different
Only to have white hair caused by the trouble that never comes
And a gale more powerful than all of the guns ever
Crying need leading astray and steals her gentle smile away came
Made two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for DANGER
And all for the sake of imitating mum and dad there's good and bad down cul-de-sac and sanctuary making two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for danger
Jeopardy and risk is ten miles high
Seeming to believe when seeing wakes me near morning
And gives me right of way
All all all my friends are leaving always are kept to the day
Or thrown away
I'm saving up for the lighter hours and the safety of war
Named you 'Fly' as a joke and it stuck fast like mud sticks fast
And hung up on the wall it's all and
Everything I need to do it's all and
Everything I do is showing through my aging lines and living on
Mr. Right says 'what is a sin in difficult times?'
Ah! As it's showing through my aging lines
It could mean something other
I'll beat you to the last one at any given time
It never leaves me high
I'm only seeding, only seeding
Brave sun shines on me on my own, it's only for me
Ah! As cold as can be, in an English sea which could mean something other
She knows birthright of her babies, has eyes for the future
We say what has to be said as we wait for the lighter hours
Mr. Right says 'what is a sin in difficult times?'
Ah! As it's showing through my aging lines
Brave sun shines on me on my own, it's only for me
Ah! As cold as can be, in an English sea which could mean something other
He shone down the stairs
Careful Sun
Day when he can move anything with his eyes
He wants to be the leader of the skies
Aims to see the starry sky with his own eyes
Wants to be the leader of the starry skies
All the people make signs as sparse as nothing if at all
Commiseration in a generous new size appealing to us all
Wins some, craves fun, keeps the world as his disguise
Stays young, brave Sun, he aims his cannon to the skies
Ah, must have been zero fizz that caused our lantern to depart
And now best not be moved because it's sad to trust a broken heart
Crave fun, brave Sun, he aimed his cannon to the skies
Slave
Hung brave Sun
He moved the turret with his eyes
And he can't shut up light without thinking but what can I do?
Zealous antics puzzled lazy boy
Gazing at him in the zoo
Makes a vow to quench all fury and rid the air of me and rid of you
Brave Sun! Brave Sun!
(he points the barrel to the sky)
Climbs in, brave Sun
(and then out of the cannon he flies)
And he met another guy, (the leader of the starry sky)
He's here, but burning at such speed that no good dog can obey
Crave fun, brave Sun!
He keeps the world as his disguise
Slave. Hung brave Sun!
The leader of the starry skies
From the tops of the trees to the
Bowels of the Earth
Swings from pillar to post 'cos he's here... and now
And now he's here
I wash my love with dew's wet dream
I walk my love in morning's gleam
Our love, I know, will never go
I strive to keep her aglow
Out head heavy lovers charms
I hold my love in my arms
In my arms I hold her
She loves me
Her view must feed me when I wake
So, with her as a bride, I'll take
Our love, I know, will never go
I strive to keep her aglow
Out head heavy lover's charms
I hold my love in my arms
Duck tells me that I must look a treat
I look my best, so I tell him 'scrub my head and feet, make me nice and neat'
I'm a different man so they say, ha ha ha ha
Roger sees me and begins to cry without warning
'Why are you more than me?'
'I am right so make me wrong your horsey skin won't make The Somme
Your voice is left... disarm me!'
Duck say the horse is daft... (alright)
Sing with your heart and be satisfied with mourning
Duck says you've disowned me
We are full of horsey love but we won't pull if you don't shove
You're faceless in this army
(Horsey going 'round with his little wheel on the floor)
Sulking in the cupboard is a horsey going 'round with his little wheel on the floor
Sulking in the cupboard is a DUCK
Mr. Flower. He's bent on fucking power
He grazed his face to claim his place then claimed he did some more
'I am right so make me wrong your horsey skin won't make The Somme
Your voice is left... disarm me!'
HORSEY GOING 'ROUND WITH HIS LITTLE WHEEL ON THE FLOOR SULKING IN THE CUPBOARD IS A HORSEY GOING 'ROUND WITH HIS LITTLE WHEEL ON THE FLOOR SULKING IN THE CUPBOARD IS A...
Make me nice and neat make me look a treat oh FUCK OFF!
Be kind and put me to sleep please I won't be long
But don't be sad when there is nothing like a lullaby
To steal away and then decide is cake on top and real inside
Appreciate and leave behind
The love is bad, the love is kind
Duty command and mystery
A shout, and all of history
And never really thought about
Probed in depth and forgot about
To fall on evil days
Troop home to grots and caves
The latest spade to build a moat
A ship to mend and send afloat
And all the fishes in the sea
Around the sides of my country
Will follow ship to where she lies
And close in fruitless sleep her eyes and
Disconnect and comfort me
Safe in the arms of my country
Her water sweats from high
And peels me where I lie
Troop home to silent grots and caves
Troop home and mimic as you go
The mourning winding of the waves
Which to their dark abysses flow
And out her water that sweats from very up high
Peels me where I lie
In the mirror and in the reflection
His horsey head made him sob for his mum
All he wants to do is quietly breathe
They spoilt him by breaking him
Snip off and snap arms,
Things that make him and never grow back
In the mirror and in the reflection
His horsey head made him sob for his mum
The life and soul cries himself blind for shorter life
A sight for eyes
The life and soul
Dull as ditch water and swallow whole
The birthright of a baby soul
Covers her baby with mothers hole
One day he's born and he likes the world
And all she holds, she says she's round, and in the ground
Life all around, life all around and it takes him down
The dark's too brown to see what's here but it keeps him warm
And it knows no fear like day or year
Poison in my idle mind makes quick work for the
Mephistopheles
Who quickly makes his excuses
To heaven his own course he sets
With a mind to save his soul and mine what's falling to thinking
Pretty girl oblivion, hostility and suspicion
So what creates competition?
Pipe retracted
Stowed away
Cover the baby without thinking as if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from all danger but not very far
Not very far
Sleeping quietly dreaming the last moments of some
Medicine and national song, all upside down
It came out wrong and turned me on
It turned me on
It turns me sleeping quietly dreaming the last moments of some
Drowning girls and drowning boys
Bob up and down like stupid toys
They bob like you who loved me too
Who loved me just in time to cover the baby without thinking
As if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from all danger but not very far
Not very
Cover the baby without thinking as if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from the danger but not very far
Not very far
In my home, my daddy TV brings in all mother world
And she sings so fine
Springs hope and fears all on the world
We must with a tombstone brave shut the shark out from his grave
Wash him bloodless smooth him fair
Stretch his limbs, sleek his hair
Home, this my own receptacle which has seen better days
And a cap full of wind for assistance moves my sea
When pace is easy under sail, though it's taking a while
Better watch better watch I don't blink and...
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Pain. Penalties his gain. He's dead. Laying stiff in the arms of assistance
Bringing in life from all around daddy TV brings in all mother world!
(blink)
Isolation comes again in the shape of a child made of plastic
Put tears on its stupid face
(blink)
Isolation comes again in the shape of a child made of plastic
Put tears on its stupid face
Blink and isolation goes on happy as the day is long
Bringing in life from all around
Daddy TV brings in all mother world
Home, this my own receptacle which has seen better days
And a cap full of wind for assistance moves my sea
When pace is easy under sail, though it's taking a while
Better watch better watch I don't blink and...
From my country spring hope and fears for all mother world saying
We must with a tombstone brave shut the shark out from this grave
Wash him bloodless smooth him fair
Stretch his limbs, sleek his hair
Blink! Isolation goes on happy as the day is long and it drag its slow length along
All over the world
And she sings so fine
Springs hope and fears
Love's smell for the stench of honey
Easy life and love for money
Violent shrieking sirens of warning
Aeroplanes up in the evening
We split a wing of that one tiny fly
In the world that he thrives
In the world that he dies on
Other world
Birds of ill omen forever
Airmen lay their heads together
In the once that he dies, getting heard
Get a word in as I know you deserved
As I saw you deserved
In as deserved
One single fly, flying and singing
Flying in a room, singing heard
In a room as deserved
We split a wing of that one tiny fly
In the world that he thrives
In the world that he dies on
Shot pilot blind and a sight for his eyes in the
Air where he flies
In the air where he dies
We split the wings, tiny blue Spitfire wings
Thousands shot, pilot blind, and a thousand tiny flies
And that thousand's to be won
To be won in their thousands
To be won
Caught in the field like a DIRTY GREAT POWER
Like THUNDER AND RAIN
Summonsed by NATURE when summonsed by name
Safe in a house, close to door, hide his brain
Life there's fear there's hope all for the best
Raw head and bloody rest might shake their bones to
Paste and glue
Starting the beginning of me/you
Please mum and I hope that my dad means mum and I
Hope that dad please mummy
Tell me to do all the things I do
All things I do
Screwing my courage to the sticking place
Never a good race, never a good race
I 'Hail All Hail' and give my life to live FOREVER
To walk some coal and take some strain ALIVE
All with lovely love on my side
Waiting to see which way he will jump to find which hole he's to creep into when he's old and tired
Not expecting to carry on and
When he's away day goes by day
And his old friends die
His hope and fear's a SECRET for his only child who's expecting and carrying on in a different style
Washed so bland via remedy man
Stand for all that he can stand, throws a canker to the can
Moults a hair putridity man, he's a very special man
He's a very special man
Lies to rest in difficult care for your pleasure
To be there, dissolves in a bed of chair
Reechy institutional man
Walking on fire bright
Something is stealing his feeling again
Lick wounds he HEALS and still feels there's some pain
Washing his DIRT in the MUD and the RAIN
Safe as house against a wall of air and noise
A bucket full of everything he needs... needs
Preserver in for her and him SURVIVE
All with lovely lovely love on their side
Moults a hair putridity man
Squeak hard if he can for his girl
Left his hand for sex with a man, with a different man
Squeak hard fatty man squeak thin fatty man
Shriek and dance to a different noise
Shriek thin fatty girls
Shriek thin fatty boys
Girl boy world puts heads in a whirl
Shriek thin fatty boys
Shriek thin fatty girls

To take her back, the break that never works and find all dust
And the steel in my mind urges me to carry on and
Preserver in for her and him

He's a very special man
Beauty Peacock Butterfly Man
He's a very special man
He's a very special man
Seemly Shining Fireproof Man
Stands for all that he can stand

What's the point in giving us hands
At the plate staring
And he's left with so much on the side
If it comes alive shift with spoony fork and knife
Break it
Walk
Safety away from strife
Kind and cutlery finds a pea and punctures with a hole
All the dinners roll into the safety bowl for feasts of reason and the flow of soul
Bins the bowl as he says...
"Falsehoods and a man of straw is all my eye and Betty Martin saw"
One day in a different way I will give myself a role in this petrifying life
Walking and breathing,
Water a never be the same
Try a new scheme
A man's machine
And I try at my best
And I try giving all I can and hold it to the window of the world closing my eyes
One day in a definite way I will test the heat of the water with everything in sight
I mean until I am full as an egg ready to burst
Try a new scheme
With a man's machine with an insight to try
And I try at my best
And I try and I cry and I listen to the bustle of the day passing me by
There is life in me left to strike a blow for effect
Still born goes the everso closely guarded line
Oh
One day in a different way I will give myself a role in this petrifying life
Walking and breathing,
Water a never be the same
Try a new scheme
With a man's machine with an insight to try
And I try at my best
And I try and I cry and I listen to the bustle of the day passing me by
There is life in me left to strike a blow for effect
Hahahahahahahahahahaha...
Still born goes the everso closely guarded line
Oh
Pretty teeth scrapy clean
With a wind-up machine
I'm feeling very striking
It's taken to my liking
It's a fine man who cups his breath
With a will to please
Wipey hand across the blazer
No-one here makes a sound
Standing up or sitting down
We grin like alligators
Assist with apparatus
Theres a strange feeling in my mind
And the room's too warm
And lit with MacDonalds lighting
And the tool the tool forever
Falling down planes against the grain
Of the wood for the box for my soul
And my aching heart
The tool forever falling down planes again and
The tool forever falling down planes again and
All of the noise takes me to the outside where there's all
Creations joining in celebrating happiness and joy
All around the world, on land and in the sea
All of the noise takes me to the outside where there's all
Creations joining in celebrating happiness and joy
All around the world, on land and in the sea
(In the sea!)
I find I understand the rules but cannot find the reasons
Do they include everything and they change for every season
It's only a matter of...
Time is of the essence, shall I put up some resistance?
Cursed with the awareness of my own existence
It's only a matter of...
Time tends to pass by quicker than the nail (Yes)
That boxes me together forever it forms the seal (Yes)
Is the knowledge of my own existence real?
I find I understand the rules but cannot find the reasons
Do they include everything and they change for every season
It's only a matter of...
Time tends to pass by quicker than the nail
That boxes me together forever it forms the seal
Is the knowledge of my own existence real?
A slice of life a piece of mind
Laid on a plate of my own kind
I'll take a key from the gravy
And unlock the cage that holds the ravens in
What's it like flying high?
I've a cone for a beak, but the tar makes me cry
That holds me together, tarred and feathered
Breathing at home, hoping for the day
The radio and television's thrown the rest away
Oh dear me, look who's come around
Now all I have to do is hide my body in the ground
It's all I have to do
When they who to the sea go down
And in the waters ply their toil
Are lifted on the surges crown
And plunged where seething eddies boil
Sarah: Bill
Bill: Yes?
Sarah: Have you just had a wash?
Bill: Yes
Sarah: You smell lovely!
Bill: Thank you very much
Tim: Hello? I am allowed in here, am I?
Oh, don't knob on your own face, you filthy DOG!!!
Left to
Live out
Our lives
On Earth
Unplug Katie, crush the orange
Wash the insides, toast the peelings
Break the kitchen, play the windows
Play the floor, the tiles and ceiling
Look out here is hoover standing ugly at the door
His pretty little tubing's getting sucked into the floor
The floor says "This is dangerous", the fridge is unaware
That everything it closes on is living without air
"Plug it in the wall and it works," oven cries
Little drops of grease, all dirty brown but clean inside
Big house, small house, tumbling around
Its a nail the knives and forks and the table to the ground
And unplug Katie, crush the orange
Wash the inside, toast the peelings
Break the kitchen, play the windows
Play the floor the tiles and ceiling
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Left to live out my life on Earth
Mary's house is upside down
She burnt the floors to make them brown
But left to her devices, bored by bluntness
She would take pleasure
In finding something pointier
In finding something pointier
In finding something pointier
In finding something pointier
In finding something pointier
In finding something pointier
Wishing for money is a man growing old and he
Breaks our knife's edge with his care for the ordinary
Winning hand in hand, Michael Miles plays a game for me
Liberace asks after me and all my family
On down the line
A soldier hides his worn uniform in an eiderdown
Says "Never mind the war, take me home again
For the last time"
Jim parades a toy that he won on a rifle range
Holds him up high, it's a plaster statue of Peter Glaze
It says the strangest things
And all we feel is lonely just like stoneage dinosaurs
Wishing for money is a man growing old and he
Breaks our knife's edge with his care for the ordinary
And Mr T. offers me and all humanity a safe place to be
And all we feel is lonely just like stoneage dinosaurs
Little glad laughing makes a prickly noise
But when with the boys he breaks his toys
Clicks when he hops (the crip) and he stops
To strike at the face that stops his clocks
Better next time we want it to be
Be just as happy for me
For all the things we wanted to be
Take care and keep life a rolling on
Signs and beams and visions swank
Their display clear as the day
Right clear for my eyes
All glitter tin supporates
Like a prat with excess
To celestial bliss and glory
Gas gun, limelight, beacons beam
Apparitions that leave me
Blind as a beetle
God says;
"It's easy, everything is easy"
And I can't find what to say
'Til I find the start
And I won't love 'til I gain
For myself a heart
All the haves and the havenots
And everything's as sound as clean
And everything is easy!
And it wins in my esteem
For flies above the rest
Libations on your mind
You maintain the best is now
And it pains all everything
Takes us to the start
And I won't know 'til I gain
For this self a heart soul
To breathe again to lay the flame
To ring action to my soul
Displace to fuel the flame
Make way for everything to behold
From the ground and in the air
It's a fabulous spectacle
Worthy of laudation
She lived among hubbering flights and sparks
She breathed them in they nested in her ears
Life is toying with bringing back again
The tool that planes against the grain
Now too much has passed but never mind
Because everything turns out nicely in the summer time
There's too many irons in the fire
There's iron loss from iron gain
And iron sadness iron pain
There's too many irons to regret
Too many irons to forget that there's
Too many irons in the fire
Too many Irons in the fire
You broke me alive
How can you do this there's only one of me
There's too many irons in the fire
There's iron guilt and iron waste
Of iron love for iron hate
There's too many irons in the fire
Too many irons in the fire
There's too many irons in the fire
Too many irons in the fire
There's too many irons in the fire
Too many irons in the fire
There's
But everything turns out nicely in the summertime
Life, everything
Dead and burying
Good man scared takes sail through his life
Let's sing of his life
Let's sing of his life
All his might against terror and fright
Let's sing of his might
All spectacular
Ridicule and fear
Good man scared takes sail through his life
Let's sing of his life
Let's sing of his life
All his might against terror and fright
Let's sing of his might
Life, everything
Dead and burying
Good man scared takes sail through his life
Let's sing of his life
Let's sing of his life
All his might against terror and fright
Let's sing of his might
Good man scared takes sail through his life
Let's sing of his life
Let's sing of his life
All his might against terror and fright
Let's sing of his might
Death a thing she hardly knew
So thin and rare and small and few
It smells just like me
And it smells just like you
She's blinded for the best
In this bright tree she makes her nest
Everyone laughs as she struggles up high
Everyone's happy and she wants to die
(There I see)
Dead is and so far everything is new
It smells just like me
And it smells just like you
Blind in safety and leafy in love
Plain ugly and homely race
With sad disgrace drawn on its face
She sleeps in the buds in a place
Where no summer shines no tears are shed
For the living or for the dead
Even love can't tell her anything
When there's blubs in her eyes shine with formaldehyde
Cries with a different feeling
When the chaos ensues with a new appetite
And in the wormless sand shall she
A feast for no foul glutton be
She's washed by the sea to a place
Where no summer shines no tears are shed
For the living or for the dead
Blind in safety and leafy in love
Rigid license severity
To drain the cup of misery
Put dirty water in their tea
Join them to the armies
What do the acts do they perform
In institution uniform
Pay in the price to pay for day
To spill or fritter away
Loosefish bad egg sad lot scapegrace
All my magnitude stops the irons entering my soul
Here I stand and I can and I like it
Rigid license severity
To drain the cup of misery
Put dirty water in their tea
Join them to the armies
Rigid license severity
Graceless is the place to be
To drain the cup of misery
To the dregs the only place to be
I'm a man seeing if I can be a bigger man
And be the big world holder
And wear it on my shoulder
Confiscate all the hearts and minds of all human kind
And give a daring operation
To deflect all life's afflictions
Nastiness disease squandermania prevails
Loosefish bad egg sad lot scapegrace
Here I stand and I can and I like it
To have no being be the null and void
To be no more leave no rack behind
So I dissolve away
So to be such stuff as dreams are made
Rigid license severity
Graceless is the place to be
To drain the cup of misery
To the dregs the only place to be
Nastiness and diseases will
Choose me any path it pleases
I don't sleep I die
My bed is always closing in on me
I dissolve
Void
Vacuum
Goosegash

Loosefish
I will stake all my pride against my suicide
And wear upon my shoulder
The mark of a good soldier
Malice having the itchy palm
With a sparing hand
Making ducks and drakes of evil
With a lesser form of people
I'm a man seeing if I can be a bigger man
And be the big world holder
And wear it on my shoulder
Confiscate all the hearts and minds of all human kind
And give a daring operation
To deflect all life's afflictions
I will stake all my pride against my suicide
And wear upon my shoulder
The mark of a good soldier
Malice having the itchy palm
With a sparing hand
Making ducks and drakes of evil
With a lesser form of people
(there be dragons)
Hail majestic corporate light
Heaven born and ever bright
How our spirit like the waves
At the breath of thine awakes
And now the night of weeping shall be
The morn of song
Ah! we are those whose thunder
Shakes the skies - the thin spun life.
Home of fadeless splendour,
Of flowers that bear no thorn
Here may the blind and hungry come
And light and food receive
Here mighty springs of consolation rise
To cheer the fainting mind
And re-creation find.
So overcome thy fear and burst into sudden blaze
Come the blind fury with th' abhorred shears
And slit the thin spun life
Ah! sobbing with their human sort of wail
Thy justice fear.
Walk in shadow, walk in dread
Loosefish walk as like one dead
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever.
Anything down there about your soul
Will smash the sun alight
Ah! yield week in, weak out from morn to night
Feelers from across the sea come crawling over thee.
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever
Come the blind fury with th' abhorred shears
And slit the thin spun life.
Ah! sobbing with their human sort of wail
The thin spun life
We are those whose thunder shakes the skies
Whose eyes this atom globe surveys
Thy justice fear
Hooray!
Tuesday and what's happening now
It's not real life, it's not fantasy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
Dear everyone, axe in me
Hoping I don't get lost in heaven
Nevermind I'll see you there
Goodbye my favourite and I don't care
You don't have to live in there
But some of us can who dare
Here comes the never
And I can't even find my shoes
Back the shed that's where she moves from me
And everyone before, leaving me inside my floor
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
Nevermind I'll see you there
Goodbye my favourite I don't care
And I really don't and I'll see you there
Leaved me in, with no definite right to leave
Me inside my floor
Tuesday and what's happening now
It's not real life, it's not fantasy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
You don't have to live in there
But some of us can who dare
Here comes the never
And I can't even find my shoes
Back the shed that's where she moves from me
'sy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
You're right she said, she nods her head

Everything I fear forever coming here to
Bless my heart and bless my soul
Leaving nerves for shot, 's only my lot
'S only my heart, 's only my hole
Everything I fear forever coming here to
Bless my heart and bless my soul
Bless my front and rear and touch my part, yes
That's my heart, yes that's my hole
Happier when head is high
Nearer sky 'cos high says I
Only one thing left inside
Pandora's box arrived inside and
Every dancing kind in me left
Leaving me
Happier when head is high
Nearer sky 'cos high says I
Only one thing left inside
Then Pandora's box arrived and
Every dancing kind in me left
Leaving me
It's only all my lot leaving my nerves for shot
'S only one thing left in th' insides
No-one free from fear leaving my parties uninvited
Anyway
Everything was fine inside
Then Pandora's box arrived
Soft and mellow sadness rised
Probed the bush like march
Except that fearful mind of mine
Packs up and carts off my fears
Treats like this, no-one lives, all babies born like babies
Happier when head is high like is. Nearer sky 'cos high is mizz
Only one thing left in this, every dancing kind in me left leaving me
Many are the same things, people invite would-be raiders
One more then back must fly for casting out by neighbours
Grubs and insects all carry on with their capers
Once in a day
Put a hand to a heart and a heart beats a path for a soul
Driving me mad
A love of a life goes it snap and I'm glad
And I say I'll have it here for just a harmless faker
Though mass hysteria here even affects me
Funny feeling you say and shown me
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's it's bound to be mine and I...
You wanted it too didn't you dear?
Yes say goodbye, yes say goodbye, say goodbye
And then I can't settle down
'S like if you park down grace like standing
Appeal to a dog
Never he mind
Stick it up grace like, a bother he minds
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's, well then it's bound to be mine
Happy to take
I say hello and I snap and I break it
And it's because it is there with all the flies sink my hand
Like it floating it stand and it
Stinks the blood out comes his eyes
Out comes his nose and...
You wanted it too didn't you dear? You know we say you tear
Then he broke it up and he snap it ribbons AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say
Goodbye grace, lost my face,
Burn it shrivelled in the human waste
And then I can't settle down and all the flies from the dog
Stinks the blood comes his eyes, comes his eyes, comes the fur
Comes the ugly dog, HIDE!
Other skills in the hands of me
And I'm in like I am
And catch as just can
And kind as ever
Put a hand to a heart and a heart beats a path for a soul
A solitary cloud, a love of a life in a world of its own
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's it's bound to be mine and I...
You wanted it too didn't you dear? You know we say you tear
Then he broke it up and he snap it ribbons AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say goodbye
Stinks the blood out comes his eyes
Out comes his nose and...
AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say goodbye
AY! AY! AY! AY!
You wanted it too didn't you dear?
Yes say goodbye, yes say goodbye, say
Goodbye grace, lost my face,
Burn it shrivelled in the human waste
And then I can't settle down and all the flies from the dog
Stinks the blood comes his eyes, comes his eyes, comes the fur
Comes the ugly dog, HIDE!
Pick the paper plates up off the floor
Hide the hands and feet inside the shed
Leave the chipping axe outside the door
Invite home and ask no-one instead
Up and makes me up jump on to my feet
And not do anything I can't eat
And all the two things that I put first
And all at the same time - Oh Christ!
Nice looking girl and a nice looking place
And I hear that they got some little ones there
Asleep upstairs
Mind if I take a peek at the nice looking girl
And the nice looking place
And I hear they've got some little ones there
Asleep upstairs
Mind if I take a peek
And I won't disturb them, even when I start to cry
Cats and the rats and the mice chase the dogs
Eat the pigs, chase the cats, eat the mice
Eat the bricks, chase the house, house the mouse
Chase the cats and the rats and the mice
Chase the dogs, eat the pigs, chase the cats
Eat the mice, eat the bricks, chase the house, house the mouse
Chase the cats and the rats and the mice
Chase the dogs, eat the pigs, chase the cats
Eat the mice, eat the bricks, chase the house
Cats and the rats and the mice chase the dogs
Eat the pigs, chase the cats, eat the mice
Eat the bricks, chase the house, house the mouse
Chase the cats and the rats and the mice
Chase the dogs, eat the pigs, chase the cats
Eat the mice, eat the bricks, chase the house, house the mouse
Chase the cats and the rats and the mice
Chase the dogs, eat the pigs, chase the cats
Eat the mice, eat the bricks, chase the house
Helen and Heaven, Earth sea and shore
Says even less than, says even more than is
Hearable anyway, even for Sandy
Life in my ankles lives in my hands
Own minds for nothing 'cept laying of
Sandy's pit lies in a field that is
Nearer than handy
Space for approval, plenty of room
Join me in closedown, sink into gloom
Watching window, see all of the news of the day and
Life without anger, life without fear
Own minds for nothing helped with ideas but the
Mouth I was feeding was sick on my hand
Waters voice and wind as one
Quake their call to Moon and Sun
Sovereign stars and throws of light
Pale before her queenly mighty ankles
Life in her ankles lives in my hands
Says even less than what even can stands in
Bold in my eyes, finally accepting deterioration
Strange men and women
Allowing themselves to be shot at
The same time
All hope and fear by night and day forever pine away
And every leaf that plumes her touch
Sails from branch to sink in dust
Hooray!
Body's feelie like I'm mad
How long it has been, more than I can count by far
And my body's feeling bad
And it's the only one I have and it's in my car
It's in my car
Better to swallow a bitter pill
If they can cut it off they will
If they can cut it off, take a pills cut it off they will
Brushing everything aside
With everything that's alive
Push the thing inside
Body's bad and it's sad
As going out to find a partner
You'd do anything for
Beware you'll soon find out
What lies about
Shrieking it shouts
Ah!
Bestest ever, what a saviour
Cherish is the word
Not really I'm too old
It'll break up my bones
Fiery furnace flew an angel in
Had to take her out and wash her down
Let's act strong like the old days
A Rizla will fix her wing
That is the best
Hallelujah
What a saviour
What a saviour
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Ah!
What a saviour
Hallelujah
Is the best ever
And saviour twice as ever
Shaking the feeling
Something's missing shake the feeling
Cherish is the word
Not really I'm too old
It'll break up my bones
Better to swallow a bitter pill
If they can cut it off they will
If they can cut it off
Take a pill cut it off
Once in my car
Once round my head
That is the best
Swallow the rest
Cherish is the word
Not really it's too old
It'll break up my old bones
It's saviour's the breaker
That's life in my shaky feeling
No not really I was lying
Was lying
Was lying
Once in my car
Once round my head
That is the best
Swallow the rest
Cherish is the word
Not really it's too old
It'll break up my old bones
It's saviour's the breaker
That's life in my shaky feeling
No not really
I was lying
Lost my chance and lost my home
Lost my energies hole
Leaves me bod and leaves me soul
Leaves me lingering whole
Leaves me lingering whole
She sustains cruel delicate care
For all her daughters feathers and fur
Unite as one to march at our side
To find the place where is to lie
Leaf and bark bone and hair
Turn to seed 'neath her stare
Seed to burst soar and rise
Ours for love is the care
Tending each everywhere
And she turns her water slow
Across her face all creatures glow
Heaven holds her breath to dear
To shake the shade from all of our fear
And put to rest another year
Timelike pulse shakes fierce through chain
With banks spread calm to reach her flame
And all is hushed through foul and din
Save for the whir and chime within
Prying eyes it's what you need
A friend that hides is friend indeed
It leaves me bod It leaves me soul
And leaves me lingering whole
Lost my chance and lost my home
Lost my energies hole
Leaves me bod and leaves me soul
Leaves me lingering whole
Leaves me lingering whole
She sustains cruel delicate care
For all her daughters feathers and fur
Unite as one to march at our side
To find the place where is to lie
Leaf and bark bone and hair
Turn to seed 'neath her stare
Seed to burst soar and rise
Ours for love is the care
Tending each everywhere
Thoughts and things devoid of soul
Unwind all creatures from the coil
We cast our coals to star the sky
And rake our ashes heaven high
All species come to bring her near
Above and below the horizon
Hung rich with dreams to wreath her brow
For good and all to recall
All species come to bring her near
Above and below the horizon
Hung rich with dreams to wreath her brow
For good and all to recall
Crazy lover like mad
And it cakes walls with sun
I shall be a sky and a hill of good
And it keeps my mind happy
Sucking breath shrieking
From my belly doing no favours
And fluid like the waves and fouling glass
And it keeps my mind happy
I've been white clean
And I taste in my mouth a worry
Everyone falls I feel fine
And I and I feel fine
Air is thin and it is hurting you
Beast of field, fowl of air
Heart of stone, man of metal
Shakes loose his core
Crazy lover like mad
And it cakes walls with sun
I shall be a sky and a hill of good
And it keeps my mind happy
I've been white clean
And I taste in my mouth a worry
Everyone falls I feel fine
And I and I feel fine
Air is thin and it is hurting you
Lost Jim, I held his fat hand
Needed to be looked after
I saw the vapours
Saw the vapours
Saw the vapours
I tried but could only think of me
Telling familiar stories
Invited us to our home for some soup
Bothered by steam
We clipped our wing, so we can't fly
Better than better than what?
Some dying off
A rocket ship
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if a day is missing
Everyone's trying to leave
Lorries driving to the sea
Who is that who slammed the door?
Looks as if a day has gone away
More active than scraps alive
Sleep for weeks but often stirring
More alive than anyone swears
As born were we from hollow trees
Telling familiar stories
Invited us to our home for some soup
Bothered by steam
We clip our wing, so we can't fly away
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if the day is playing
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if a day has gone away
Watched after by angels
And soft as moths watch on like
Beetles around me head
Multi-minded sleeper, sticky with dreams
And slept as snakes-a-sleeping and turning to tears
Soft as moths, spike all dreams inside
They're giving fear inside her aching belly
They have left in there inside
Tiny world, hell sinks me
And sinks my floating isle
Sails down
Whatever you do, let it go
And she bloods, her mouth is red, she bleeds
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Waiting and aching and all green with life
Her mouth is red, make us remember well
And see how strange it sounds
Strange as the word, no it's not the world is strange
Not as strange as the word
Soft as moths, spike all dreams in head
Blood her mouth is red, she bleeds her bed
I'm here, that is clear and left is you
So with swim we'll froth with limbs the blue
There is no bright side
There is no bright side!
While Mother keepest
Watch while and weepest
'till memories crowd
And Father mourneth
Absence his burneth
Grief will cry aloud
And no-one lives
The spores have landed
There is no bright side
Silence is golden
Even my spirit sleeps in my open hands
Wettened every flap of England's flag
Proclaimed that all around are free
And millions earthly joy remains
Fiery sparks, the eye of breaking hearts
Producing to mind in every shape and kind
Produce the mind
Had no idea, no-one did, make it quick
And I don't want to hurt
She is my witness
One more stab and its back to the shop
Or leave as things are
Vain deceit of grief
Show of unbelief
Hope to blind and brief
Hide my beloved
Death is passed
Again no more to me
Had no idea, no-one did, make it quick
And I don't want to hurt
She is my witness
One more stab and its back to the shop
Or leave as things are
Lights in darker places
Darker than lights in places
Than lights in places down far
Cold as like's recalling winters
Recalling winter
Recalling, wind says too far
Tasting her with those sensitive suckers
Sea birds destroyed her
Sea birds destroyed her nest
I don't feel like one, I don't live like one
They put me on a wheel and I said yes
Ideal
No peace of mind Ideal mind's hard to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is dying for a peace of mind
Hard as hard is to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is ideal
I say don't breathe in
It'll save you the bothering of breathing it all out again
Hens attack us I say look for yourself
A ring of suffering horses are
Ideal
No peace of mind Ideal mind's hard to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is dying for a peace of mind
Hard as hard is to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is that's all we ever do
Ideal
No peace of mind Ideal mind's hard to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is dying for a peace of mind
Hard as hard is to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is die
Ideal
No peace of mind Ideal mind's hard to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is dying for a peace of mind
Hard as hard is to find
All we ever do is die
All we ever do is ideal
Die time!

Inking off across the beds
Inking off across the, and across the thing
'cross the thing
Ink me!
Come to me exploring ah!
And joining the plankton inking off across the beds
Inking off allways
So we'll swim and froth with limbs the blue
This much, the ultimate in devotion
And sensitive suckers beating and cleaning and
Keeping me sweet and serene
Inked in my face and jetted off
Enough please, RELEASE MY HEAD!

Jetting off with thanks mistakes my turgid gland for my hand
Don't stop to WALK
Don't walk to go
Don't say anything
All the untidy knots need untying
But I lost them all
I needed to spin Good Memories
She has gone and put nails in the bannister
Providing it's for free
Let's have a look at what paradise is like
It's comfortable at times like these
My mistake was nothing like theirs
This is heaven alright but there's a
Man outside with a gun
Song for thee of infant graves
Cots, Sin, tails, forks, fiery hands
Pee-ing outside heavens
Magic Creatures what can be sparks compared to thee
Plain we make it
How we love plain and EVEN
This is EVEN
Things are fine odd
But we all like it EVEN
This is EVEN
You're on the air
You're on the water
Water's always welcome on the deck
BUT WE like it DRY
Odds can call in all day
But they AIN'T GET any ANSWERS
You're on the air
You're on the water
(three, four)
Make eyes pretty wear clean dress
And Boy get shot into the wilderness
Moving like a worms hero
Looks both ways and goes
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
Gives birth in his throat
Pin legs make his torso leak
Airs her holes
Her tiny sides going in and out
Shiny worm to heal her hole
And all the beauty tells him he is WORMS HERO
He is love and hatred
You ever believed in big strong daddy legs?
And do you believe in bad flying aeroplane?
Then you will rejoice in believing in Dog-like Sparky
He's all heaven sent but will he suffer from your sweetness
If I am a dog then shake hands
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Defenders of the world we make believe in
Put your hands on the Holy Bible and scream 'wank'
If I am a dog then shake hands
Brother, sis, we'll never ever sing like Barky
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
No feet for me and suck red upon my belly
We wanna be Dog-like Sparky
Stay alive without or without praising him off his pins
That glisten wheel-like in their shining wheely tins
Never mind as crawling is my in mind world with everything alive
Stick and suck dribble in my dirty shoes
And crown me 'everything alive'
And so the spirits they do protect him now
Where he is all spoiled
Where he's too squashed and hurt by feelings
Now eat up your hand now eat your...

Sacred patience (and a short silence) and we will be sure as eggs is eggs that Jesus'll hold his fiery hand to the gun

Secrets are in my secret box down my avenue
Suck away my tiny dress

Cleaner than a BIG MESS!"

Real (or imaginary) ice-spitting fire
(That comfortable sound)
Hands in the air both feet stood on the ground
Lassie's on my TV
I get flat on all fours and start kissing the screen
And I sit like a good dog in the hope that she might
GIVE IN TO ME
What's the matter? Neither good nor bad weather
Makes me all ill-like (Suffer with pain)
But I don't mind, he is me. "Look Lassie! Watch him until
He dies of his brain"
All or nothing (Before he dies of his brain)
Breathe in my skin ooh! It feeling too hard
Start collect the hoofs from my insect graveyard

Tiny insect hoofs AND WORSHIPPING ME

Insect hoofs on Lassie instead of his feet
(HE Lassie not SHE)
But I don't mind all she is blessed with the
Mane of a HORSE and wings of a BEE
(and carrying a cluster of bee eggies in the centre of she)
Don't do anything just stand there
Holding the line with man boy shaking all hands
If I were a bad dog you'd all be dead
Six big strong boys of the lads chewed off a piece of
Mary Magdalene's arms
While guardians wailed "Oh for shame! For shame!"
I will tear the secret from your arms
And come boys out from that hat!
I cannot see your feet!
Come on my lucky lads! You don't want to live forever!
As I live and breathe as if in danger or as if in doubt
(Ran in circles screaming "SHOUT!")
If I were a bad dog you'd all be dead
(Crucified)
I thought you were dead
All my mind's pissing out of me pouring brain
It's my slave
And I'm counting on the kitchen clean for the masses
I can save yeah I can save
I can save and I'm amazed that I can save and I'm amazed that I can save and I'm amazed
Pissy eyed gaggling's over tomorrow after eighty
After ay!
Time in now really
No! not entirely now, I lied
Now I delay
Need some funds money undone
Me on some for money undone
I know where I don't want to be
Out looking for people in trouble
Oh Hello shadow! You go away and you
Warm me up like only your fire can do
Warm me up like only your fire can do
More of the same
More of the same old highs
Kiddie voice piercing my nodder like a nail
And I can kill

Storm of feeling good fun fuck my animal heart and ache
And heart and ache
Tiring now dishing out all my fancy almond ache

It's your belly-eyed bleeder
Only just begun to rebuild him
But will he turn out like you've done
Woah!
Tiring wait 'till these things can fly
Now that I sit inside her fire
My feet firm higher Me filled with gloom
Warm me up like only your fire can do
Big belly-eyed bleeder on the top of you
I know where I don't want to be
Out looking for people in trouble
Oh Hello shadow!
You go away and you warm me
Digging to grow bigger
Jim prove himself worthy to a perfect nation
Michael could be the same
Hair by hair he will yang out the vicious horse's tail
He will learn from tic-man that he
Always thought he were bleeding glitter to win
Diggin' up grow bigger
Jim prove himself worthy to a perfect nation
Michael could be the same Bletching hard yeah!
Hard into a shaftless mind of swankledged info
Never sucking more than this than power licence
Nice and freely
(wish I could be the same)
FUCK OFF!
Man stand far away
Looks like a dot standing on his hill
Perseverance, understanding
Climb the stairs and cross the landing
Best to grin and weep
Blind be spirit-core with its lies
Burned as bright as a rocket. All falsehoods set alight
Flamed raised in shame on a speedier course
And who's to blame for
Breaking its own self-inflicted graceless home?
Blind be spirit-core with its lies
A misty veil hides a pitiful vengeance born to sail on
All of the seas and a-never returning
Needs to take some beauty sleep deep in the
Oceans and obsolete
Kindly spears core with its penknife
Blind be spirit and lost again and dust in eyed
Heavy heads get buried deeper
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a lie all dreadful Oh yeah!
When truth looks like a lie in a different way and
Kept alive and bound by bad chains in a
Beautiful cage
Inside is fear and stable minds
Always forever questioning stubborn you
Befriending your tears and in a different way
The need to take some beauty sleep deep in the
Ocean is obsolete
Blind be spirit-core with its lies
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a sea sick land all weepier
Blast me silence and hurt me ears and blast again
With a rifle all dreadful oh yeah!
Blind be spirit dust in eyed heavy heads get deep and─
Stowed away, stowed away, stowed away, stowed away
Stowed away, stowed away, stowed away, stowed away
Stowed away
Truth looks like a lie, was held it out to him
Who shook the tree viciously for LOVE
Blind be spirit and lost again and dust in eyed
Heavy heads get buried deeper
Sand in scratching naked eyes
Lost again in a sea sick land all weepier
Blast me silence and hurt me ears and blast again
With a rifle all dreadful Oh yeah!
Belly-eyed bleeder all terminal, deceive, you fibber of the order
Come swimming up a shape with a stinging tail
Jenny's bed is nailed to the floor
Black dog, tumble-weed, white dress
Play whistley wireless happy
Fireworks under her pillow
Cold girl and deadness
Can you cross your heart?
Jenny played the wireless
Black dog, white dress
Hand holding with her wireless
Kind whistling on when she passed
From this world off into the next
They were all stuck in a
Really small wood boat
To perish on the sea
And then one, one of the sailors
Pulled up the plug
And put it in a bucket
And all water, sea water, came in the boat
And a fish by accident came in
And flipped out again by using its fin
The water coming in looked like a spout
And would make them perish
And then with red fire
Coming out from his gills
Came Action Fish, and was made of metal
And cut through the waves
At one hundred miles an hour
Faster than a torpedo
Red fire coming out from his gills
And jumped into the sky
And shoved a bung into the hole in the boat
And sped off
Cutting through the waves
One hundred miles an hour
Faster than a torpedo
Red fire coming out from his gills
We cut all his eyes we did
Squeezed the lids and down the grog into hole
He skip with cow-eyed smile to the blissful
Into craggy dress and we will praise him
We will praise him off his pins
Clear him of all sins
Oh my! We sang with strength to carry on
Encouraged him to sing along
We sang of all the world and praised him HOORAY!
Stay alive to live or without
And he is down all over and out
Watch us hang on shoulders as tall and as gold as
Feely hand and finger around all we
And look to see if we care if he is heaven sent or
Hell bent but we will praise him
We will praise him all away
Praise him all away
My arms chancing and you will no way
Live long enough to repay me
I praise you anyway always
Wipes last with brown and pale
He dirty boy, he gone all stale
And down the stair and hallway crawling
And pig and toast and kitchen brawling
Night-time days are all weekless
Alarm charm, he's all up and dressed
He dirty boy, he bathroom dances
And check his jam and breathe on glasses
Spiny grip brings all off 'Mr. Regal Jelly' in hand
Warm feel and suck regal man suck bland
Suck bland away and he's a sleepy cow-eyed dog
He's treading soft sand
Kiss and stroke and praise him
Stroke and praise him
All is worth kiss
Not how to cleanse
And fowl preserver of sick somehow don't worry now
Hold his mouth and stop him breathing
Over and out!
When she was within two feet she laughed and moved away
Made him feel really sad
Saddest than he ever had
Died in earth did brother by the side of sister
No moist just dry fire
Midas feet were ruined
Merry Jesus brew in sent her soul by wire
One hand in mouth she dug into the sandy soil
All gently down she goes
And you were all fine dry worlds
All the wells are useless
And the thirsty omens don't smile on your kind
Distress is a pest
Gratified with the smallest things it make and find
Cried with her apron all over her head
She gone all gently down as always
And we can't just drive away in a nice car
A nice car
Came here all thirsty and drank from my hands
All gone
Loudly and long
Drank loudly and long
Can't just drive away in a nice car
A nice car
Choosing my resources at random endeavours
As the fool thinks so the bell clinks
Fall for my own pain
There's a tiny step from the sublime to the ridiculous
Thoroughly related which one am I?
So much to be learned from this new age of reason
This is what it shouts and screams
Loudly into my ear
Every single man he has a fool in his sleeve
Whether he wants it there or not
It breeds sanity
One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He fears his creepiest thoughts
Stupid soldier he's falling shot without purpose
Stupid soldier shot at random
Dies without respect
Where's the harm in that?
He should have kept a sane mind after all
How can he be trusted after he dies?
Level head sat proudly on the wisest shoulders
Stares an eyefull toward his sister
Smiles a wiliest smile
Isn't life a wheeze when treasure's in the trees
And I possess longer arms than you or anyone else
One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He believe in a thoughts and a laughter will reign
One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He believe in a thoughts and a laughter will reign
One step above the sublime
It amounts to the feeling inside Jon rejects
Jon rejects every feeling inside
Step above the sublime to the ridiculous
Dismissing thoughts in a head
He refuse to accept taking logic within
Within logic within everything he refuse
He fears his creepiest thoughts
All nineteen birds flying fast up
They are dead they are not alive
Bad bird you flap off you beak
High and mighty beady bird eye
Featherless me and I be all glad on my own
Doggy-eyed graceless in my home
Steps in wire
High and mighty beady bird eye
They're not alive
They eat no love
They curl up in their hollow tree
And leak the sap that bad birds do
Poison in the drops of black and white pearl
On the 'leaving the cinema' girl
Steps in wire
High and mighty beady bird eye
They're not alive
Don't linger on not pure gold in your hand
And fly again to the end of England
Sad birds flying through the famous London fog
There is no God
There is no 'alive' in my menagerie
Sad birds they are not alive
Nineteen birds flying fast up
They are not alive
(they're not alive)
Oh look
And they run back and then pat on the head
Hang on, can we not make them alive?
That's wicked
No, because like put all the dead ones in a round circle
Yeah, pretty as a picture
Why, why would they not be better alive?
Because for a lot of people
This one looks too quiet
Quiet as a mouse
Look who's coming round the corner
Hello
Do you know him?
It's tiny Bob Leith, pretty as a picture
Shall, shall we beat him senseless?
Yes, but this is where I take my time
Quiet as a mouse
Reversal of despair
Bright young spark he showing flair
Loosens flesh from machine
Granted it obscene
Thrust his fists
Fisting posts
Still insist he sees the ghost
Of what we try to see
In darkened rooms and endless laughter
Lock into theories old
Existance of all creatures told
Human eyes to snatch a glimpse
Of our lifes genesis
Lust for knife
Such is life
Love for every kind of strife
Angleworm bit in half
Fellow eaten raw and helpless
Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
Aiming high cannon my
Fear young failure to the sky
Confidence leaknesses dominate my mind
Out of blue into black Ideas meets oblivion
Endless destructible
Delusions of defeat and anguish
Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
Perfect it's not as easy to find
The good in ourselves
That we leave behind
Forever sublime
And never quite comprehend
Why that is why we try and we try
Until do us die
To pull up the soil
And plant greener seeds
Perfection an ultimate
King of all lice
Of wood ship building
Believing that his sink is clean
But Mr Sun's too high up in sky
And the sea's far too big for drowning
Erecting fin time
Cut through the ocean waves
One million miles an hour
Faster than a torpedo
Morbid seas
The morbid breeds
Untidy seas
Meanwhile on the wrong side of fences
All killing and dashing of brains
Next to normal life with games and companions
Shouting too loud for him to sing
Are all his blackbirds
Inside the steely metal gut of famous
Action Fish cutting the waves
Firing hot red fire from his gills
The more we steals
The more we feels
She is only trying on a leafy crown
She's looking in the mirror
And kind glass knows her too well
'Dig deep' she's told
Ah well, no gold
And let's drink soup to misfortune
Her complete faith is eager to serve as her mirror
Where she wants to be
In one small step nearer
She'll soup her mirror
She's souped her mirror
Now that's what I call a story
It's not your fault
That we want to go home at the end of every street
There you go my son
Thank you you're welcome
There you go my son
Thank you you're welcome
There you go my son
Thank you you're welcome
All fear and power
All ready for warning me
Askew with red jetted eye
All as a day in sand (and rain)
And when you're near all me now
And then think never before did it seem so far away
All hostile to me
The nerve is bared, the sense is real
There's places and houses fired
Inspires all fire in the inside you
Times are fine find all nine
And nurses find me in again
Treating our mazey kiteman
Rolling off his belly
Papering his length all off his swing
He mask his hand and he grin
To stay here, or even to play here
Rather than be kept in on his own
We only know what doesn't show
What to, don't ask me why
Oh we're in again and we're all the same
Red as egg laid on the page
Don't mind the unbalanced mind
It's fine and mine and yours too
Share with me and me is clean and
Treating our mazey kiteman
Rolling off his belly
Papering his length all off his swing
But I don't really think so
Maybe
I don't think I care
So no-one else can know
Ah well, another day
Now, now
Tasting sweet and beautiful
But awful too
Here comes the bride
No-one knows where she came from
Ghostly lady is here to warm your bed
Both now and in the life everlasting
Leaving something in the air
Here comes the bride
No-one knows where she came from
He would give himself ten showers a day
In the murky ponds and weedy rivers
And it was wicked of you big dead boy
Suddenly just went to sleep
Well here we are
I could walk with angels
But I'd rather walk with you
(You are) only a foundling
Ghostly lady is here to warm your bed
Both now and in the life everlasting
Leaving something in the air
Here comes the bride
Nobody knows where she came from
It carried its home on its back
When it came
Saying he was for me a spell
Could be good could be bad
Soak him in some water
And it will be good
Or wear him as a shirt for week
And call him by a name
But bad if I burn him
(Ahhh)
Don't stop now
I didn't know you'd be growing wings
This is how long you'll stay alive
Don't! Stop it!
You're my only friend yeah
(Ahhh)
Right, so now I give your name "Baz"
How does that sound?
How is it so far?
Are you good to me yet?
Ohh. Oh. Mm
Or are you bad to me?
On a quiet night
Put him on the fire
There
There
Only because I don't want him to burn
Elsewhere
Oh don't stop now
I didn't know you'd be growing wings
This is how long you'll stay alive
Don't! Stop it!
You're my only friend yeah
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
Wounded spawn from our devils open sore
Was even more bloody than before
Said "Don't you get me!
Don't you spoil the air with all your craziness!
Don't you get me!
Fuck you! You don't you get me!"
There's good cud
There's dead good sticker sing
Mercy alive hot dog love's a-winnin'
"Don't you get me!

Don't get for all time

I'm a wastrel I'm a sisters boy
Mercy alive hot dog loves in oh joy
Said "Don't you get me!
Don't you spoil the air with all your craziness!
Don't you get me!
Get someone else, don't get me!

Wimping out for baby god
No grudge nothing not even fear
Only he was a lamb
Nursed his hate hand he cut it on a jag
Oh spotty Sallys army
All win they dared all sayed 'yeah'
Dashed back calling out alarms
Enough to wake the dead Freds
Dead Freds
With their hair waving all lazy and soft
Like meadow grass under the flood
Rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
All the rains is cold
Best thing gone did ever have
It was a good boy not bad
With whole body just a-quivering
With cleanliness
Hate hand take the soul through drizzle ditch
And the wormy vegetable garden bitch
Hide your hate hand in your secret place
Your hate hand hide your hand
Now you remember children
How blessed are the pure in heart
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Them dead good?
Like the only fish in the river
Not safe 'cos they all had stones
All had stones
With rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
Wind and rains is cold
Hide your hair it's waving all lazy and soft
Like meadow grass under the flood
Rains cold and the wind blows
All the rains is cold
Wind and rains is cold

What the fuck are you doing?
Bend this spine out of mine
Oh I'm loads of rain, shower me!
Jelly muddy on strength of their bodies
And all I get is an odd feeling
Bend this spine out of mine
Feet seen my lies, seen my fear in all the air
And seem like clay
Junior all pale again
So panic red and barmy eyed and
Broken as a bird in air with strangers
Beating a scene and pleased beneath me
Kicking at air better to eat with
Ah! Lightly carving away
And be wed all she wares
And if the 'sceeters don't get him
Then the 'gators all will
And junior is a jitterbug
Chesty and blue, a still born mouthful
Slid away and hid himself in the earth's face
All good news for now
Rods make buildings in the sand pit
Fiona kissed my desk
Me I just stay out the way
Old ounce weights all blown upside down
Air, light, and labour saving devices
All sun skim her I don't want to go home
Drag back, lighting up time
Thin yellow on the cotton white
And the beautiful strangers stripes were green
And make her full of secrets
And sounded like her name
And sounded like her hair
Which I tried to smell but made a funny face instead
Lie for the beads, they are not for me
Hide them in a match box
Made all special with white cotton wool
Keep the ones that click on teeth
Hand me back the ones that won't
Hand me back the rest with the box
I love you
You mistake you-self heavily
Will you this?
Is your master home?
Yes Sir!
Is it up?
No Sir! He sleep yet!
It come in ones how is it you are in bed yet
Suck bear daddy she stink all clean
Upon my soul upon her life
She dog a - sleep all eyes open
Prays all our own jelly as fear yeah!
Grizzle yeah oh and contain me
Grizzle oh yeah and contain me
Since you not go out
I shall go out nor I neither
That may dead if I lie you
She dog a - sleep all eyes open
Prays all our own jelly as fear yeah!
The sun rise on sun lie down
Upon my soul upon her life she dog
Asleep all eyes
I feel very very bloody complete
Says if I falls froggy squish
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!
Hooray yeah! Oh! Hooray yeah-eah ah!
Hooray yeah! Oh yeah! Oh Hooray yeah!

Clean that evil mud out your soul
Sweet heaven save me from that candle
Burned it up it burned, it stank so strong
Of hell fire
Heaven can only know what unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens
All spawn of my own flesh and blood
All spawn of my devils own strumpet
Them olden days and them hard times
And merciful heaven only knows
What unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens
Weren't you afeared little lambs down there
In all that dark down there
In that deep place made all flesh all blood
For these eyes of mine
What a joy divine
Merciful heaven only knows
What unholy sights and sounds
All we innocent babes has made in them dens
Weren't you afeared little lambs down there
In all that dark down there
In that deep place made all flesh all blood
For these eyes of mine
What a joy divine
What's up with eyes?
What's up with everyone's sad leaky
Wet and wincey eyes?
All a-drippin' in time
I gives to prayin' over that he will be
No entertainment for the crowd
When he hangs up
Roll them on, I don't know
Don't try to understand them
Brand them, brand them in the eye
Whats up with eyes?
What's up with everyone's sad leaky
Wet and wincey eyes?
How he hangs up
So easy to damage a bee or a
Precious red ruby all dirty
Ain't he messy though
Sleep them well all them dry bones
After we shot to his death
The horse and the rocking boy
Folded up like a dead balloon
All breathing not welcome
Ah kiss me I'm sore
Million eyes watching all but this
Worth a kiss on this phiz
All on this phiz and more
Oh my saviour create me to die alone
I'm what you flush I'm your children
Nursing a desire with poison
Mothering stray waifs with germs
All trying to kill them
Then sleep better and easy
Awaken all the guilties
Now come down here for all of us
And throw this off axis
Without trying too hard
Starry shake and awaken all the guilties
Protect the innocent lambs
Make we sleep better and easy
All his loss all not was
And where is his eyes?
Think on this you did not miss
Didn't know if your distress
Were short not everlasting
Sleep thee well better and easy
All this loss no what cost no more
No more the horse and the rocking boy
Million eyes watching all but this
Worth a kiss all on this phiz ah!
This is ah!
This is ah!
Plant me oh joy!
Oh my saviour create we all to die alone no
No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boy
No more the horse and the rocking boy
Mandy trained up her head to
Away itself go when is told
Head revealed its whereabouts
In a thicket by calling "here... I'm here!"
And in tones of deep solemnity
Pronounced that she is dead
Said she had left her torso
Too excited to listen and naked
Love gone lost of all faith in
Divine intervention flying birds on a string
Lowest neck down half of she
Scandalously flies her hawks
Outside my house
She'll only go if I address her coffin
As the ship whereon she must launch
Out into eternity
And renounce all dancing
Renounce loose living
And cricket
Same thing everyone doing thee
And don't even know if it's been planned
They will attack and kill
Don't even think about it
Not one of us, not one of you
But two hundred thousand
Snapping at the arms of the big padded body with a black dog
Gags and fills out with sock
No longer heaven keen birdy swoop down to address its mess
Pretends its Jesus
Missed that chance to sing
Missed that only chance
Dying to snatch eden
Charm enough to choke
All gag and bleed with gusto
Will bleed amen
"Find no good no kind but find guilties of sins
Sufficient enough to hang an army"
In
So in
God save the past
So in it makes me nothing like these
So
Not out
Not sorry leaving me all not sorry I breathed
"They will attack and kill
Attack and kill they will
The where and the how I leave to you"
And in all this glory
Was high as ninety was high as say
Eats his words as they die in his mouth
Eats his words as they
Choke the tic as it grows
Catchy lays of its eggs in her turfy thrill
And lost them on her lawn
Wishing could brush them all aside
But still
So be it all lucky charm
Enough to choke
All bleed and all gag with gusto
Will bleed amen
Think of them families souls
You're sending them to their deaths
Oh I can't see that well
It's just gloss
Dressing up like a princess in secret
Like swans
In secret, secret like swans
Swans
Can't suck marvellous marvels
Really have plan
In wide world
In wide world, in all the wide world
Stab that fork it’s a spark a-thundering!
Call that a globe? It’s a big round world!
Superficially good lookin’!
A precious red ruby all dirty!
You was that bird until nest time!
When you jump outa your skin and away away!
Stop stop sniggering for a fortnight!
‘til your worn out and aged bold and brave!
No! Want no go and jump outa my skin!
No virtue no sin!
No go down and let him in!
I try to keep my feet a-dry!
Not wet and bog and swingin’ in y’ nightgown!
What rods made the stodge a-thicker
Than anything more than the limit?
Chubby faced child
Put corpse in the ground!
Put song all around!
Sang "all away away!"
Cattermouth displays its feelings
Wear like second skin to shed
And when like when it’s pulled tight
As can be it wrinkle like an old neck
Ways to be love it too much
Green is crispy, flaky to touch
All tortoise headed smiling there
Contorts avoiding ugly glare
Hungry mouths to feed
Sick aggregate
Sworn in, scorning
Fast and just wheezing for air
And hail
Golden phrasing I
Lights and principles
Only squeaking
Luck’s ferocious left hand
Stalled
Now multiply a ten-strong baying million
All charred, all hearts full of hurting
Testifying in me
Thwart this ditzy scene
Gilded capital
Hanging, swinging
Loss of fury, heed, loss of spark
Raise! Pull!
Now multiply a ten-strong baying million
All charred, all hearts full of hurting
Testifying in me
Please calming time and disarm to cease this lynching army
Bad hour, condemned and revolting
Lasting out not shortly
All ranting, merciless chanting, smash my legs beneath me
Lives darkly, this is the moment
Honest, this is rid me
Mother fear, always worried
Something got the wrong idea all around and knows
It may well be
It's like as many overboard as they say
Overboard on we D-Day gather
Light of my
All of my life
All of my life
Be good size
You got it right
Not just two hundred
Be a good size
Be good size
Be good size
We do lack, do we lack
Our lucky spirit of friendship all around
All freedoms they not be allowed no more
It's all to do with, I'm not really good at this
Sometime is like all the worst crap you ever did see in front
Of your eyes all at once sometime
You got it right
Not just two hundred
Be a good size
Be good size
Light of my
All of my life
All of my life
Be good size
Be good size
Ah well
How she do it, spark by a house
At least what is left of it now
You got it right
Not just two hundred
Be a good size
Be good size
Light of my
All of my life
All of my life
Be good size
Be good size
Light of my
All of my life
All of my life
Be good size
You got it right
Not just two hundred
Be a good size
Be good size
Be good size
He is all up and down in the dry ground
It is all one thing nothing can
Wake up out of it or
Wake up into it dare he
He just whatever come never be all
Build high together's anything
Ask and they go high
Fly together birds say he
Sensed his living
Still we call him
Till he'd die out
Of this place
He can tell you
All you nearly
Need no wants more
He don't know
All he'll owe
He is all up and down in the dry ground
It is all one thing nothing can
Wake up out of it or
Wake up into it dare he
He just whatever come never be all
Build high together's anything
Ask and they go high
Fly together birds say he
In the heart of
The stone where they
Hit like me
He's not laughing
You candied carp
Made all up
Made all up
He is all up and down in the dry ground
It is all one thing nothing can
Wake up out of it or
Wake up into it dare he
He just whatever come never be all
Build high together's anything
Ask and they go high
Fly together birds say he
He is all up and down in the dry ground
It is all one thing nothing can
Wake up out of it or
Wake up into it dare he
He just whatever come never be all
Build high together's anything
Ask and they go high
Fly together birds say he
He is all up and down in the dry ground
It is all one thing nothing can
Wake up out of it or
Wake up into it dare he
He just whatever come never be all
Build high together's anything
Ask and they go high
Fly together birds say he
Think of a way
Then always go the other way
In customary evenings, legendary mornings
Louder than drums and softer than a cloud
Leaves being blowed away
Hard as soft nails and knives and even
Harder than pulling a soldier off your sister
Hands were all shaking they're all of his fingers
Son stop staring yond
If you look your eyes will grow germs
You can't pick them up 'cause they're glued to the floor
Made it unkind (not money) for not staring all day at them
And has your mother sold her mangle
Last time I did saw her, she was in a dream dress
Playing with flies in the weeping willows' dank dark ditch
So not so perfect
But seeing as how it is a funny kind of apple who practices every day
There’s room for a big forgive and a surprise and adventure
And what adventures
And all only for feat are
They building a long slide
And along it they glide
Danger all around and without a sound
Bound on the ground
I am the git that walks all by himself
Your bargain was by me
All places are alike to me
"How did I get here?" said I, who can’t believe me eye
Hands are all shaking
That out all of his fingers
Hands they were all shaking
Then all of his fingers
Hands were all shaking they're all of his fingers
